//! Fair Resource Distribution Algorithm
//!
//! This project provides an implementation of the `fairdist` algorithm, a way to distribute a set
//! of resources fairly amongst a dynamic number of users. Its infrastructure manages a hierarchy
//! of users that currently hold shares of a resource. New users can be added at any time, and
//! charges can be requested and released dynamically. The system ensures that every new user
//! joining the system gets a guaranteed share of the total, regardless of how many users already
//! hold resources.
//!
//! The API abstracts over resources through the `[counter::Counter]` trait. This trait represents
//! a set of numeric resource counters. In most cases these will just be `usize` integers.
//! However, that is not a requirement. The resource counter is only required to "look like an
//! integer" (see `[counter::Counter]` and its dependencies on the `num` crate). Furthermore, the
//! API abstracts over users. It does not track users who interact with the system, but relies on
//! the API user to provide a key or index that identifies the user of a given operation. This way
//! the resource allocators can tell whether separate operations are performed by the same
//! accounting user, or whether they are different. This is all information the system needs about
//! the different users.
//!
//! At the root level, the API user has to create a `[Resource]` object with the resource counters
//! initialized to reflect the total resources available for distribution. These resources can now
//! be requested through `[Charge]` objects. Charges are RAII-type objects that record a resource
//! charge and make sure resources are released again when the `Charge` is dropped. To request
//! resources, the API user must specify the accounting user to perform the charge as, as well as
//! the amount to charge. If the quotas of the accounting user were exceeded, the charge is
//! rejected. Otherwise, the charge will be granted. The allocators behind the resource objects
//! make sure resources are distributed fairly. Additionally to the root-level `[Resource]`
//! objects, the API allows to create sub-hierarchies to redistribute resources further. That is,
//! new non-root-level `[Resource]` objects can be created given the accounting user to act as.
//! This new sub-resource will then behave similar to the top-level resource and allow charges to
//! be performed. It will ensure the same guarantees on its own sub-level, so the sub-distribution
//! is again fair. Furthermore, the top-level guarantees are unaffected by sub-hierarchies that
//! are formed. That is, individual accounting users cannot increase their resource shares by
//! creating sub-hierarchies.
//!
//! There are multiple possible algorithm that can be used for the individual allocations. In most
//! cases the selected default is sufficient. However, the `[allocator::Allocator]` trait allows
//! selecting from a range of predefined allocators, as well as creating individual allocators.
//! The default allocator guarantees quasilinear shares to every user of the system. In
//! particular, this means regardless how many users join the allocation system, each one is
//! guaranteed a share of 1 over `O(n * log(n)^2)` of the total.

// Reference to a Registry Object
//
// Registries hold our internal usage maps as well as the associated resource counters. Since we
// need shared access to the registry from different threads, we put it into a reference counter
// lock. The `RegistryRef` type is an alias for this.
type RegistryRef<A, C, I> = Arc<std::sync::Mutex<Registry<A, C, I>>>;

// Usage table of a single consumer
//
// The resources of a registry are distributed amongst different users. The users are not
// represented in any way. Instead, we only require users to have a unique index of type `I`. We
// then track a usage table for each user. This table records what the user did so far and makes
// sure all accesses through the same user share a common usage table.
//
// Note that the usage table of a specific user can be pinned via the `[Subscription]` type. This
// avoids doing a look-up on each modification. However, it means access to the usage table is
// shared. Therefore, the `[Subscription]` type implements safe sharing of references to the usage
// table.
//
// All fields except for `share` are static. They are not modified during the lifetime of a usage
// table. The `share` field is protected by the mutex of the linked registry. However, for
// performance reasons it is located on the usage table rather than as a separate lookup tree on
// the registry. You must lock the registry when accessing `share`!

// Resource registry
//
// A resource registry is the hidden root object for resource distribution. The registry tracks
// the resources that were assigned to it, as well as all usage tables which got shares of its
// resources.
//
// A resource registry is usually hidden behind a reference counted mutex, which must be held to
// perform any kind of modification.
//
// Resource registries form a hierarchy. The root level resource has no parent resource but has
// resources assigned statically. Each subscription to this resource registry can itself be turned
// into a resource registry, though. This allows subdividing and distributing resources amongst
// hierarchical systems. Note that sub-hierarchies never affect the shares granted on parent or
// sibling hierarchies. That is, access to sub-hierarchies can be delegated to untrusted parties
// without affecting the security of the entire system.
